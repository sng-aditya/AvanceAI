# Production Optimizations & Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the production optimizations implemented to improve performance, reduce memory leaks, and clean up logging.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Logger Utility** (`src/utils/logger.js`)
- Created centralized logging system with log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- Production mode uses structured JSON logging for log aggregation
- Development mode uses pretty-printed logs with emojis
- Automatically reduces verbosity in production (only ERROR and WARN logs)

### 2. **Session Monitor Service** (`src/services/sessionMonitor.js`)
- **Graceful WebSocket Lifecycle Management**
  - Automatically connects WebSocket when users log in
  - Gracefully disconnects WebSocket when no active sessions exist
  - Saves resources by not maintaining connections when unnecessary
  
- **Features:**
  - Monitors active user sessions every 30 seconds
  - Cleans up expired sessions every 5 minutes
  - Removes revoked sessions older than 30 days
  - Removes expired sessions older than 7 days
  - Prevents WebSocket connections when no users are active

### 3. **WebSocket Service Improvements** (`src/services/websocketService.js`)
- Added proper logger integration
- **Memory Leak Prevention:**
  - Added `setMaxListeners(20)` to prevent EventEmitter memory warnings
  - Clear reconnect timeouts properly
  - Remove all event listeners on disconnect
  - Clear all data caches (marketData, optionChainData, strikeOHLCData) on disconnect
  - Clear subscriptions on disconnect
  
- **Improved Disconnect Method:**
  - Graceful cleanup of all resources
  - Prevents memory leaks from lingering event listeners
  - Resets connection state properly

### 4. **Database Configuration** (`src/config/db.js`)
- Integrated logger for consistent logging
- Disabled Mongoose debug mode in production to reduce log noise
- Cleaner error messages

### 5. **Application Startup** (`src/app.js`)
- Integrated session monitor to manage WebSocket lifecycle
- **Graceful Shutdown:**
  - Handles SIGTERM and SIGINT signals
  - Closes WebSocket connections gracefully
  - Closes server connections with 10-second timeout
  - Proper cleanup on exit
  
- **Logging Improvements:**
  - Replaced morgan 'combined' with 'dev' in development only
  - No access logs in production (reduces noise)
  - Startup messages use new logger

### 6. **Service Logging Cleanup**
- **DhanService:** Converted all console logs to structured logger
- **SecurityLookupService:** Reduced verbose logging, debug logs only in development
- **Routes:** Conditional logging - only log fallbacks in development mode

## Benefits

### Performance
- ✅ Reduced CPU usage by not running WebSocket when no users are active
- ✅ Memory usage optimization through proper cleanup
- ✅ No unnecessary API connections when app is idle

### Memory Leak Prevention
- ✅ Proper EventEmitter listener management
- ✅ Cleanup of all data structures on disconnect
- ✅ Timeout clearing to prevent orphaned timers
- ✅ Event listener removal to prevent memory retention

### Production Readiness
- ✅ Clean, structured logging for log aggregation tools
- ✅ Reduced log noise in production
- ✅ Debug logs only in development
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling

### Resource Efficiency
- ✅ WebSocket connects only when users are logged in
- ✅ Automatic session cleanup
- ✅ Reduced database queries for expired sessions

## Usage

### Environment Variables
```bash
NODE_ENV=production  # Enables production optimizations
```

### Log Levels
- **Production:** Only ERROR and WARN messages
- **Development:** All log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)

### Monitoring
The session monitor provides:
- Active session count tracking
- Automatic WebSocket lifecycle management
- Session cleanup metrics

### Graceful Shutdown
The application now handles shutdown signals:
```bash
# Send termination signal
kill -SIGTERM <pid>

# Or Ctrl+C
# Application will:
# 1. Stop accepting new connections
# 2. Close WebSocket gracefully
# 3. Close database connections
# 4. Exit cleanly
```

## Testing

### Test Session Monitor
1. Start the server
2. Login with a user - WebSocket should connect
3. Logout - after 30 seconds, WebSocket should disconnect
4. Check logs for session monitoring messages

### Test Graceful Shutdown
1. Start the server
2. Press Ctrl+C or send SIGTERM
3. Verify clean shutdown in logs

### Test Memory
1. Run the app with `node --expose-gc src/app.js`
2. Monitor memory usage over time
3. Should see stable memory with no leaks

## Future Improvements
- Add metrics endpoint for monitoring active sessions
- Implement connection pooling for multiple WebSocket instances
- Add Redis for session storage in multi-instance deployments
- Implement rate limiting per user session
- Add session activity tracking for analytics

## Notes
- Session check interval: 30 seconds
- Session cleanup interval: 5 minutes
- Graceful shutdown timeout: 10 seconds
- Default log level in production: WARN
- Default log level in development: DEBUG
