# ðŸš€ AI-Powered Trading Platform

## Project Overview
A sophisticated full-stack trading platform that demonstrates advanced AI agent engineering capabilities through intelligent market data processing, automated strategy execution, and real-time financial analytics.

## ðŸŽ¯ AI Agent Engineering Highlights

### Intelligent Market Data Agent
- **Real-time WebSocket Integration**: Built intelligent agents that interface with Dhan WebSocket feed for ultra-fast market data
- **Binary Data Processing**: Advanced binary message parsing for ticker, quote, and option chain data
- **Hybrid Data Architecture**: WebSocket for real-time data + API for static data (balance, orders, holdings)
- **Data Caching Layer**: In-memory caching system for instant market data retrieval
- **Rate Limiting Intelligence**: Smart rate limiting for API fallbacks while WebSocket provides unlimited real-time updates
- **Error Handling & Recovery**: Robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff

### Automated Trading Strategy Engine
- **Multi-Strategy Management**: Engineered agents to monitor and execute 5+ trading strategies simultaneously
- **Performance Analytics**: Real-time P&L calculation and performance tracking
- **Risk Management**: Automated position monitoring and risk assessment algorithms

## ðŸ”§ Key Technologies
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT, bcryptjs
- **Real-time Data**: WebSocket (ws), Binary data parsing, Event-driven architecture
