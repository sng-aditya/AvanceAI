# Stock/Index OHLC Chart Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented OHLC (candlestick) chart functionality for stocks and indices. When users click the "Chart" button on the landing page (after login) or dashboard, they now see a custom candlestick chart using historical OHLC data from the Dhan API instead of opening TradingView.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend - New API Endpoint
**File**: `backend/src/routes/marketData.js`

Added new route: `GET /market/stock-ohlc/:symbol`

**Features**:
- Accepts query parameters: `fromDate` and `toDate`
- Supports all 3 indices and 8 stocks currently tracked:
  - **Indices**: NIFTY_50, BANK_NIFTY, SENSEX
  - **Stocks**: RELIANCE, TCS, HDFCBANK, INFY, WIPRO, ICICIBANK, SBIN, BHARTIARTL
- Uses correct security IDs and exchange segments:
  - Indices: `IDX_I` exchange, `INDEX` instrument
  - Stocks: `NSE_EQ` exchange, `EQUITY` instrument
- Returns OHLC data in the same format as the strike OHLC endpoint
- Defaults to current date if dates not provided

**API Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "timestamp": [1696320000, 1696320060, ...],
    "open": [2850.50, 2851.20, ...],
    "high": [2855.30, 2854.80, ...],
    "low": [2848.90, 2850.10, ...],
    "close": [2852.40, 2853.50, ...],
    "volume": [125000, 130000, ...]
  },
  "source": "api_historical",
  "metadata": {
    "symbol": "RELIANCE",
    "securityId": "2885",
    "exchangeSegment": "NSE_EQ",
    "instrument": "EQUITY",
    "fromDate": "2025-10-03",
    "toDate": "2025-10-03"
  }
}
```

### 2. Frontend - New Stock Chart Page
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/StockChart.tsx`

**Features**:
- Clean, professional UI with price information card
- Time range selector with buttons: 1 Day, 3 Days, 5 Days, 1 Week, 1 Month
- Real-time price display with change amount and percentage
- Shows Open, High, Low, and Volume statistics
- Uses the existing `CandlestickChart` component (same as option chain)
- Responsive loading states and error handling
- Back button to return to previous page
- Refresh button to reload data
- Dark mode support

**Component Structure**:
```typescript
interface OHLCData {
  timestamp: number[];
  open: number[];
  high: number[];
  low: number[];
  close: number[];
  volume: number[];
}

interface CandleData {
  time: string;
  open: number;
  high: number;
  low: number;
  close: number;
  volume: number;
}
```

### 3. Frontend - Updated Components

#### `App.tsx`
- Added import for `StockChart` component
- Added new route: `/dashboard/stock-chart`

#### `MarketData.tsx`
- Updated both index and stock "Chart" buttons
- Changed navigation from `/dashboard/charts` to `/dashboard/stock-chart`
- Indices: Green "Chart" button between "Watchlist" and "Option Chain"
- Stocks: Purple "Chart" button in the actions column

#### `RealTimeMarketData.tsx`
- **Added new "Chart" button for indices** (previously only had Watchlist and Options)
- **Added new "Chart" button for stocks** (previously only had Watch and Trade)
- All Chart buttons navigate to `/dashboard/stock-chart?symbol=SYMBOL`
- Maintains consistent color scheme across the app

## Time Range Calculation Logic

The date ranges are calculated as follows:
- **1 Day**: fromDate = toDate = today (intraday data)
- **3 Days**: fromDate = 3 days ago, toDate = today
- **5 Days**: fromDate = 5 days ago, toDate = today
- **1 Week**: fromDate = 7 days ago, toDate = today
- **1 Month**: fromDate = 1 month ago, toDate = today

## User Flow

1. User logs in and lands on the dashboard
2. Views real-time market data for 3 indices and 9 stocks
3. Clicks "Chart" button on any stock or index
4. Navigates to `/dashboard/stock-chart?symbol=RELIANCE` (for example)
5. Sees candlestick chart with default 1-day data
6. Can select different time ranges (3d, 5d, 1w, 1m)
7. Can refresh data or go back

## Key Points

### âœ… Implemented
- Custom OHLC charts using Dhan API data
- Time range selector (1d, 3d, 5d, 1w, 1m)
- Candlestick visualization
- Price statistics (Open, High, Low, Volume)
- Chart buttons on all market data displays
- Proper security ID mapping for all symbols
- Error handling and loading states

### âœ… NOT Modified (As Requested)
- Option Chain section remains untouched
- Expiry and strike OHLC functionality unchanged
- WebSocket implementation for option strikes intact
- Historical data fetching for options preserved

### ðŸ“Š Data Source
- Uses Dhan API endpoint: `POST /charts/intraday`
- Same endpoint as option strike OHLC
- Different payload structure for stocks/indices vs options:
  ```javascript
  // Stock/Index payload
  {
    securityId: "2885",
    exchangeSegment: "NSE_EQ",
    instrument: "EQUITY",
    interval: "1",
    oi: false,
    fromDate: "2025-10-03",
    toDate: "2025-10-03"
  }
  ```

## Security ID Mapping

All security IDs are hardcoded in the backend route for the 3 indices and 8 stocks:

| Symbol | Security ID | Exchange Segment | Instrument |
|--------|------------|------------------|------------|
| NIFTY_50 | 13 | IDX_I | INDEX |
| BANK_NIFTY | 25 | IDX_I | INDEX |
| SENSEX | 51 | IDX_I | INDEX |
| RELIANCE | 2885 | NSE_EQ | EQUITY |
| TCS | 11536 | NSE_EQ | EQUITY |
| HDFCBANK | 1333 | NSE_EQ | EQUITY |
| INFY | 1594 | NSE_EQ | EQUITY |
| WIPRO | 3787 | NSE_EQ | EQUITY |
| ICICIBANK | 4963 | NSE_EQ | EQUITY |
| SBIN | 3045 | NSE_EQ | EQUITY |
| BHARTIARTL | 10604 | NSE_EQ | EQUITY |

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend route responds with OHLC data for all symbols
- [ ] Frontend StockChart page loads without errors
- [ ] Chart buttons navigate to stock-chart page
- [ ] Time range selector updates the chart
- [ ] Price statistics display correctly
- [ ] Loading and error states work properly
- [ ] Dark mode styling is consistent
- [ ] Back button returns to previous page
- [ ] Refresh button reloads data
- [ ] Option chain functionality still works (not affected)

## Files Modified
